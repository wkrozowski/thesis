abstract = {The theory of finite automata is closely linked with the theory of Kleene's regular expressions. In this paper, two formal systems for the algebraic transformation of regular expressions are developed. Both systems are consistent and complete; i.e., the set of equations derivable within the system equals the set of equations between two regular expressions denoting the same event. One of the systems is based upon the uniqueness of the solution of certain regular expression equations, whereas some facts concerning the representation theory of regular events are used in connection with the other.},

abstract = {In the semantics of programming, finite data types such as finite lists, have traditionally been modelled by initial algebras. Later final coalgebras were used in order to deal with infinite data types. Coalgebras, which are the dual of algebras, turned out to be suited, moreover, as models for certain types of automata and more generally, for (transition and dynamical) systems. An important property of initial algebras is that they satisfy the familiar principle of induction. Such a principle was missing for coalgebras until the work of Aczel (Non-Well-Founded sets, CSLI Leethre Notes, Vol. 14, center for the study of Languages and information, Stanford, 1988) on a theory of non-wellfounded sets, in which he introduced a proof principle nowadays called coinduction. It was formulated in terms of bisimulation, a notion originally stemming from the world of concurrent programming languages. Using the notion of coalgebra homomorphism, the definition of bisimulation on coalgebras can be shown to be formally dual to that of congruence on algebras. Thus, the three basic notions of universal algebra: algebra, homomorphism of algebras, and congruence, turn out to correspond to coalgebra, homomorphism of coalgebras, and bisimulation, respectively. In this paper, the latter are taken as the basic ingredients of a theory called universal coalgebra. Some standard results from universal algebra are reformulated (using the aforementioned correspondence) and proved for a large class of coalgebras, leading to a series of results on, e.g., the lattices of subcoalgebras and bisimulations, simple coalgebras and coinduction, and a covariety theorem for coalgebras similar to Birkhoff's variety theorem.}

abstract = {The greatest fixed point of a set functor is proved to be (a) a metric completion and (b) a CPO-completion of finite iterations. For each (possibly infinitary) signature Σ the terminal Σ-coalgebra is thus proved to be the coalgebra of all Σ-labelled trees; this is the completion of the set of all such trees of finite depth. A set functor is presented which has a fixed point but does not have a greatest fixed point. A sufficient condition for the existence of a greatest fixed point is proved: the existence of two fixed points of successor cardinalities.}
