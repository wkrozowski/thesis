abstract = {The theory of finite automata is closely linked with the theory of Kleene's regular expressions. In this paper, two formal systems for the algebraic transformation of regular expressions are developed. Both systems are consistent and complete; i.e., the set of equations derivable within the system equals the set of equations between two regular expressions denoting the same event. One of the systems is based upon the uniqueness of the solution of certain regular expression equations, whereas some facts concerning the representation theory of regular events are used in connection with the other.},

abstract = {In the semantics of programming, finite data types such as finite lists, have traditionally been modelled by initial algebras. Later final coalgebras were used in order to deal with infinite data types. Coalgebras, which are the dual of algebras, turned out to be suited, moreover, as models for certain types of automata and more generally, for (transition and dynamical) systems. An important property of initial algebras is that they satisfy the familiar principle of induction. Such a principle was missing for coalgebras until the work of Aczel (Non-Well-Founded sets, CSLI Leethre Notes, Vol. 14, center for the study of Languages and information, Stanford, 1988) on a theory of non-wellfounded sets, in which he introduced a proof principle nowadays called coinduction. It was formulated in terms of bisimulation, a notion originally stemming from the world of concurrent programming languages. Using the notion of coalgebra homomorphism, the definition of bisimulation on coalgebras can be shown to be formally dual to that of congruence on algebras. Thus, the three basic notions of universal algebra: algebra, homomorphism of algebras, and congruence, turn out to correspond to coalgebra, homomorphism of coalgebras, and bisimulation, respectively. In this paper, the latter are taken as the basic ingredients of a theory called universal coalgebra. Some standard results from universal algebra are reformulated (using the aforementioned correspondence) and proved for a large class of coalgebras, leading to a series of results on, e.g., the lattices of subcoalgebras and bisimulations, simple coalgebras and coinduction, and a covariety theorem for coalgebras similar to Birkhoff's variety theorem.}

abstract = {The greatest fixed point of a set functor is proved to be (a) a metric completion and (b) a CPO-completion of finite iterations. For each (possibly infinitary) signature Σ the terminal Σ-coalgebra is thus proved to be the coalgebra of all Σ-labelled trees; this is the completion of the set of all such trees of finite depth. A set functor is presented which has a fixed point but does not have a greatest fixed point. A sufficient condition for the existence of a greatest fixed point is proved: the existence of two fixed points of successor cardinalities.}

As a consequence of this result we obtain that finitely generated convex (positively convex, absolutely convex) algebras are finitely presentable. Convex algebras are important in the area of probabilistic systems. In particular positively convex algebras are, as they are the Eilenberg–Moore algebras of the subdistribution monad.}

author = {Valentin Antimirov},
abstract = {We introduce a notion of partial derivative of a regular expression and apply it to finite automaton constructions. The notion is a generalization of the known notion of word derivative due to Brzozowski: partial derivatives are related to non-deterministic finite automata (NFA's) in the same natural way as derivatives are related to deterministic ones (DFA's). We give a constructive definition of partial derivatives and prove several facts, in particular: 1.(1) any derivative of a regular expression r can be represented by a finite set of partial derivatives of r;2.(2) the set of all partial derivatives of r is finite and its cardinality is less than or equal to one plus the number of occurrences of letters from A appearing in r;3.(3) any partial derivative of r is either a regular unit, or a subterm of r, or a concatenation of several such subterms. These theoretical results lead us to a new algorithm for turning regular expressions into relatively small NFA's and allow us to provide certain improvements to Brzozowski's algorithm for constructing DFA's. We also report on a prototype implementation of our NFA construction and present several examples.}

abstract = {Iteration theories provide a sound and complete axiomatization of the equational properties of the iteration (or fixed point) operation in many models of theoretical computer science including ordered and metric structures, trees and synchronization trees. All known equational axiomatizations of iteration theories consist of a small set of equational axioms for Conway theories and a complicated equation scheme, the commutative identity. Here we associate an identity with each finite semigroup. We prove that the set consisting of the Conway identities and the group identities associated with the finite (simple) groups is complete. Moreover, we prove that the Conway identities and a subcollection of the semigroup identities associated with a subclass of the finite semigroups is complete iff each finite (simple) group divides one of the semigroups in the subclass. We also formulate a conjecture and study its consequences. The results are a generalization of Krob's axiomatization of the equational theory of the regular sets.}

According to Tarskiʼs fixed point theorem, this least fixed point can be obtained by (possibly transfinite) iteration of F, starting from the least element ⊥ of the lattice. The smallest ordinal α such that Fα(⊥)=Fα+1(⊥) is known as the closure ordinal of F. We prove that if F is also continuous with respect to the sup-norm, then its closure ordinal is ω. We also show that our result gives rise to simpler and modular proofs that the closure ordinal is ω.}

abstract = {Since a nondeterministic and concurrent program may, in general, communicate repeatedly with its environment, its meaning cannot be presented naturally as an input/output function (as is often done in the denotational approach to semantics). In this paper, an alternative is put forth. First, a definition is given of what it is for two programs or program parts to be equivalent for all observers; then two program parts are said to be observation congruent if they are, in all program contexts, equivalent. The behavior of a program part, that is, its meaning, is defined to be its observation congruence class.The paper demonstrates, for a sequence of simple languages expressing finite (terminating) behaviors, that in each case observation congruence can be axiomatized algebraically. Moreover, with the addition of recursion and another simple extension, the algebraic language described here becomes a calculus for writing and specifying concurrent programs and for proving their properties.},

abstract = {Markov categories are a novel framework to describe and treat problems in probability and information theory. In this work we combine the categorical formalism with the traditional quantitative notions of entropy, mutual information, and data processing inequalities. We show that several quantitative aspects of information theory can be captured by an enriched version of Markov categories, where the spaces of morphisms are equipped with a divergence or even a metric. Following standard practices of information theory, we get measures of mutual information by quantifying, with a chosen divergence, how far a joint source is from displaying independence of its components. More strikingly, Markov categories give a notion of determinism for sources and channels, and we can define entropy exactly by quantifying how far a source or channel is from being deterministic. This recovers Shannon and Rényi entropies, as well as the Gini-Simpson index used in ecology to quantify diversity, and it can be used to give a conceptual definition of generalized entropy. No previous knowledge of category theory is assumed.},
